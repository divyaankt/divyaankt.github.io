Happy New Year to all!! In order to compliment my Body Transformation Challenge this year, I have decided to challenge myself intellectually as well through the above <a href="https://nptel.ac.in/">NPTEL</a> courses.

Learning more about GPU Architectures and Programming has been on my mind since my final year of Undergrad. However, it kept getting delayed for one reason or another. I aim to finish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOam2jFb700&list=PLbRMhDVUMngfj_NXI7jqMYLnhcRhRKAGq&ab_channel=IITKharagpurJuly2018">this</a> course by Prof. Dey from IIT Kharagpur, along with all the assignments and the final, in person certificate exam. I aim to use the book <a href="https://diveintosystems.org/book/">'Dive Into Systems'</a> and the videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HPCEducation">HPC Education</a> to plug my knowledge gaps if needed.

I strongly feel that a course on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8R784VtXBg&list=PLJ5C_6qdAvBFMAko9JTyDJDIt1W48Sxmg&ab_channel=IntroductiontoParallelProgramminginOpenMP">'Parallel Programming with OpenMP and MPI'</a> would serve as a great companion to the above course on GPUs. I aim to earn a certification in this course offered by Prof. Sabharwal from IIT Delhi. 

Furthermore, the <a href="https://github.com/rutgers-apl/rlibm">RLIBM</a> project coupled with my current work involving high precision, Finance APIs, has developed my proclivity towards Numerical Analysis. I aim to follow through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8HrMF1kh3c&list=PLOzRYVm0a65d0WWST6wvOP6m7VRQyRgSa&ab_channel=IITBombayJuly2018">Numerical Analysis course</a> offered by Prof. S Baskar from IIT Bombay and hope that it helps me develop solid foundations in the various algorithms that power modern Numerical Computing Systems today.

Lastly, given that it forms the basis of almost all Deep Learning Models today, I aim to broaden my understanding of Mathematical Optimization by taking Prof Ghosh's NPTEL course titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUCY8dO4FoE&list=PLFW6lRTa1g826LOxwrZyKDDhV5750FG9Y&ab_channel=IITKanpurJuly2018">'A Primer to Mathematical Optimization'</a>.

Juggling these 4 courses along with my full time job is no joke! However, I'm sure that I would be able to finish all of these courses and enrich myself intellectually.
