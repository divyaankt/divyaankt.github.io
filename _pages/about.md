Hi there, I'm Divyaank Tiwari! I'm currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. Due to my deep interests in the Systems domain of Computer Science, I'm currently pursuing an Independent Study under [Prof. Erez Zadok's](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ezk/) in his [File systems and Storage Lab (FSL)](https://www.fsl.cs.stonybrook.edu/). In FSL, I'm working under [Yifei Liu](https://www.fsl.cs.stonybrook.edu/~yifei/), who seeks to test kernel file systems more readily and thoroughly by model checking and other related techniques. I formerly worked at MSCI for 3 years as a Associate Quantitative Software Developer (SDE-II). Prior to that, I completed my BE in Computer Engineering from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology in 2020. In my free time, I can be found either in the gym, browsing through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) or whiling away my time on subreddits like [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions), [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) and [r/Cricket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/).
