Hey there!! I'm Divyaank Tiwari, a Quantitative Software Developer (SDE-II) working at MSCI. I completed my BE in Computer Engineering from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology in 2020. I'm an inquistive person, interested primarily in the Systems domain of Computer Science. In my free time, I can be found whiling away my time at subreddits like [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions), [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) and [r/Cricket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/) or browsing through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news).
