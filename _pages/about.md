Hi there, I'm Divyaank Tiwari! I'm currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. Since August 2023, I have been working as a Graduate Student Researcher in [Prof. Erez Zadok's](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ezk/) [File systems and Storage Lab (FSL)](https://www.fsl.cs.stonybrook.edu/). In FSL, I'm working with [Yifei Liu](https://www.fsl.cs.stonybrook.edu/~yifei/) along with [Prof. Scott A. Smolka](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~sas/) and [Prof. Geoff Kuenning](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/geoff.html), on the [Metis](https://github.com/sbu-fsl/Metis) project which seeks to test Linux-based file systems more readily and thoroughly via Model Checking techniques. I formerly worked at MSCI for 3 years as an Associate Quantitative Software Developer (SDE-II). Prior to that, I completed my BE in Computer Engineering from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology in 2020. In my free time, I can be found either in the gym or browsing through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) or whiling away my time on subreddits like [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions), [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) and [r/Cricket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/).
